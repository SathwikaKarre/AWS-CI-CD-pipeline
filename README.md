# AWS-CI-CD-pipeline
Automated CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline for seamless code deployment from commit to production.
AWS CI/CD Process

This document describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) process using AWS services. It outlines the steps for automating the software development lifecycle, from code commit to production deployment, utilizing AWS Developer Tools and services like CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline.

## Overview of the CI/CD Process

In this process, we'll automate the following stages:

1. Source: Code is stored in a source repository (AWS CodeCommit).


2. Build: Code is built and tested using AWS CodeBuild.


3. Deploy: The application is deployed to AWS infrastructure using AWS CodeDeploy.


4. Pipeline: The entire process is managed and automated using AWS CodePipeline.

## Benefits of AWS CI/CD

Scalability: AWS services scale automatically to accommodate growing workloads.

Automation: Continuous integration and deployment reduce manual interventions and the possibility of human errors.

Consistency: Ensures that the same process is followed for every deployment, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.


## CI/CD Process Workflow

1. Source Code Repository - AWS CodeCommit

AWS CodeCommit is a source control service that allows you to store your source code securely.

Developers push their code to CodeCommit, which triggers the CI/CD pipeline.


2. Build Stage - AWS CodeBuild

AWS CodeBuild automatically builds and tests the code after each commit.

You define the build specifications in the buildspec.yml file in the root of your repository.

Example buildspec.yml:

version: 0.2
phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      java: openjdk11
    commands:
      - echo Installing dependencies...
  build:
    commands:
      - echo Building the application...
      - mvn clean install
artifacts:
  files:
    - target/*.jar


3. Deploy Stage - AWS CodeDeploy

AWS CodeDeploy automates the deployment of applications to Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda, or on-premises servers.

After the build stage, CodeDeploy will automatically deploy the artifacts generated by CodeBuild to your production or staging environment.

CodeDeploy uses an AppSpec file to define deployment instructions.

Example AppSpec.yml:

version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
  - source: /target/my-app.jar
    destination: /home/ec2-user/my-app.jar
hooks:
  AfterInstall:
    - location: scripts/install_dependencies.sh
      timeout: 300
      runas: root


4. Automation with AWS CodePipeline

AWS CodePipeline is the orchestration service that automates the CI/CD pipeline.

It integrates with CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy, allowing you to automate the flow of code changes from source to deployment.

A sample pipeline consists of the following stages:

      1. Source: Pulls code from CodeCommit.
      
      
      2. Build: Triggers AWS CodeBuild to compile and test the code.
      
      
      3. Deploy: Deploys the built artifacts using AWS CodeDeploy.




5. Testing: Integration and Unit Tests

In the build phase, you can also run unit tests and integration tests.

CodeBuild can be configured to run unit tests using popular frameworks like JUnit, NUnit, or PyTest, depending on your application stack.


6. Monitoring and Logging

AWS CloudWatch is used to monitor the performance of your application, infrastructure, and pipeline.

CloudWatch provides logs for build, deployment, and application runtime, helping you identify and troubleshoot issues.


## Example AWS CI/CD Architecture

Source (CodeCommit) → Build (CodeBuild) → Deploy (CodeDeploy) → Monitor (CloudWatch)

Steps to Set Up the CI/CD Pipeline in AWS

## Step 1: Set Up CodeCommit

1. Create a repository in AWS CodeCommit.


2. Push your code to this repository.



## Step 2: Configure CodeBuild

1. Create a new project in AWS CodeBuild.


2. Define the buildspec file in your project repository.


3. Set the source to CodeCommit.



## Step 3: Set Up CodeDeploy

1. Create a new application in AWS CodeDeploy.


2. Define the deployment groups and attach them to your EC2 instances or Lambda functions.
3. Create the AppSpec.yml file to define deployment steps.



## Step 4: Create the CodePipeline

1. Create a new pipeline in AWS CodePipeline.


2. Add the Source, Build, and Deploy stages.


3. Set up triggers to automatically run the pipeline when changes are pushed to CodeCommit.



## Step 5: Monitor and Troubleshoot

1. Use CloudWatch to monitor logs from CodeBuild and CodeDeploy.


2. Set up alarms to alert you if there are failures or issues during the CI/CD process.



## Conclusion

By using AWS Developer Tools like CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline, you can easily automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. This reduces manual errors, improves development speed, and ensures the consistency of deployments across environments.
